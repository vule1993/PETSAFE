SPRING/REACT/REACT APPLICATION ALLOW PET OWNERS TO STORE THEIR PET INFORMATION/VACCINATION/FOOD AND SHELTER SEARCHING
Abstract:

Pets are an important factor in family life nowadays. Owners care more about their pets and want them to live longer, healthier and happier. The need for pet care inevitably increases, since better living conditions and healthier food are factors that owners will consider to give their pets a better life. There are a lot of websites and resources to provide pet food and services, so it is simple and easy for owners to get what they need for their pets. The supply of pet services might not be enough in challenging circumstances like pandemics, floods, drought, etc. Pet food will be out of stock and pet services such as hospitals, shelters might be closed. In addition, all the petâ€™s information such as vaccination certification papers would be damaged due to the bad weather conditions. Almost all houses have pets so the demand for these services is likely to be higher than the supply in challenging situations. This project focuses on seeking the essential pet daily supply and other healthcare services in challenging circumstances. The system will use the mapping technique to guide the owners to the resources they need, or suggest available substitutes if the concerned resources are not available. It will help the owners to find the closest available pet service to them.
